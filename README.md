## Description

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using Express.js and Mongoose packages, it also uses the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

## Instruction

> In order to use this application you will have to download the repository, or fork it and clone it, and open it up in your chosen terminal (Vs.Code, GitBash, Terminal for Mac, etc.). Then you will have to ensure that node package manager(NPM) has been installed (using "npm install" in the terminal). If you are not planning on attaching this to a front end and deploying it, you will need to use a site like Insomnia to test the API routes. If you do use Insomnia, the video attached at the top shows what will occur. Good luck!
